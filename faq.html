            <summary>Which matches are included in the rankings?</summary>
            <p>
              Singles matchplay results from the Ryder Cup (since 1927), Presidents Cup (since 1994), and WGC Match Play (since 1999)
              are included. Foursome and four-ball formats are currently excluded but will be added at a later date.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How are player ratings calculated?</summary>
            <p>
              Ratings are calculated using an Elo-style system. Every new player starts at a rating of 1000,
              and then gains or loses points after each match based on the result and the difference between
              their rating and their opponent's rating. This ensures that strength of schedule is taken into
              account. There is also a K factor which increases the amount of points new players can earn, 
              and a decay which means inactive players' ratings slowly drop.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What does “Active” mean in the filters?</summary>
            <p>
              Active players are those who have played a matchplay match within the last five years,
              based on the current year.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Are halved matches treated differently?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. A halved match awards 0.5 points in records and is treated as a draw in
              the Elo calculations.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Why do some players have fewer matches?</summary>
            <p>
              The archive focuses on singles matchplay events only, so players who primarily
              competed in team formats or in different eras may have fewer recorded matches.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How often is the data updated?</summary>
            <p>
              The archive is updated after each new matchplay event. We publish updates as new
              results become available and verified.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Can I compare two players head-to-head?</summary>
            <p>
              Head-to-head comparisons are in progress. For now, use player filters to
              review individual match lists and records.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do team points count toward the rankings?</summary>
            <p>
              No. The rankings only use individual singles match results to keep comparisons
              consistent across events.
            </p>

            <summary>Where does the data come from?</summary>
            <p>
              The dataset is compiled from official event results and curated to align names,
              rounds, and scores across competitions. A range of sources from Wikipedia to 
              the PGA Tour to the Ryder Cup are used. They have been compiled with the help
              of AI tools but always sense checked by a Human before being published here.
