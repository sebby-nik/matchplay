# Ryder Cup Matchplay Database

A lightweight, static MVP for browsing individual player records across major matchplay events. This project is designed to grow into a complete historical archive, starting with a clean data model and a simple, fast UI.

## Features
- Player search with sortable rankings
- Full match list per player
- Event-level filters (Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, WGC Match Play)

## Structure
- `index.html` — main page layout
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `app.js` — UI logic + filtering
- `data.json` — match data source

## Run Locally
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Next Steps
- Populate `data.json` with full matchplay data
- Add additional matchplay events
- Add richer metadata (rounds, venues, field size)
